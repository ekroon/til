# Github Pages

## Custom Domains: `USERNAME.github.io` repo is special

If you configure your `USERNAME.github.io` repo to have a custom domain:
- With the settings (which creates a CNAME file in the root)
- By manually adding a CNAME file with a single line containing the domain

Then: all the repositories you publish to pages from you account will be available under
`CUSTOMDOMAIN/REPONAME`. This will override any other directory you have published from your 
`USERNAME.github.io` repo GitHub page.
